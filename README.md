MuKit is a user interface components library written in Swift.

As we always use the same or a really close object, with a one time definition with UIAppearence, we made severals components that we want to share with you.

## MuCore

Everything shared by all the components, as the MUNibView or other stuff.

## MuComponent

All the components, and more soon.

### MUButton

An easy button to customize and use.
